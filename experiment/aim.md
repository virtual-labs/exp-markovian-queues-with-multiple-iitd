#### The experiment aims to predict the behaviour of systems that attempt to provide service for randomly arising demands through the M/M/c model. More specifically, for an independent customer arriving in a system with multiple server, the number of customers one sees on arrival in the system, the waiting time in the system, the number of customers in the queue, the waiting time in the system and the average service time of a customer can be examined through the experiment.
